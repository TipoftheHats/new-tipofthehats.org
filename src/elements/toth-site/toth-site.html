		<h1>Say, what *is* Tip of the Hats?</h1>
		<p>Tip of the Hats is a charity event hosted and supported by members of the TF2 community. Since 2013, it has
			raised over $450,000 for Children's Oncology Services, Inc., which offers camps and other educational and
			excursion programs throughout the year that allow children with cancer to just be kids. With your help,
			COSI can offer attendance to kids at little to no cost to their families.</p>
