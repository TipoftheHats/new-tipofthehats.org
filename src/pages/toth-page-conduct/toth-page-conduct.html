			<h1>Preamble</h1>
			<p>Tip of the Hats exists to raise funds for charitable causes.</p>
			<p>We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.</p>
			<p>Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices will not be tolerated.</p>

			<h1>tl;dr</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Be respectful.</li>
				<li>We're here to help: <a href="mailto:abuse@tipofthehats.org">abuse@tipofthehats.org</a></li>
				<li>Abusive behavior is never tolerated.</li>
				<li>Data published to tipofthehats.org and its related video content is hosted at the discretion of the administrators, and may be removed.</li>
				<li>Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the Tip of the Hats community.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Scope</h1>
			<p>
				We expect all members of the TotH community, including staff, volunteers, viewers, and donors, to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all TotH community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to TotH affairs.
			</p>

			<p>
				This policy covers the usage of the TotH donation tracker, as well as the TotH website, TotH related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf of Tip of the Hats. It also applies to behavior in the context of the TotH communities, including but not limited to Twitch chat, social media, public GitHub repositories, mailing lists, and public events.
			</p>

			<p>
				This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of the Event.
			</p>

			<p>
				The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the Tip of the Hats abuse team.
			</p>

			<h1>Friendly Harassment-Free Space</h1>
			<p>
				We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.
			</p>

			<p>
				Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.
			</p>

			<p>
				Harassing other viewers, donors, participants, volunteers, or staff of the Event is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.
			</p>

			<p>
				Avoid using offensive or harassing language that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.
			</p>

			<p>
				Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.
			</p>

			<h1>Reporting Violations to this Code of Conduct</h1>
			<p>
				If you believe someone is harassing you or is demonstrating some other form of malicious or inappropriate behavior, contact <a href="mailto:abuse@tipofthehats.org">abuse@tipofthehats.org</a>. If this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.
			</p>

			<h1>Consequences</h1>
			<p>
				All content published to the Event, including donation messages and video content, is hosted at the sole discretion of the TotH administrators.
			</p>

			<p>
				Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, staff, volunteers, or others with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
			</p>

			<p>
				Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
			</p>

			<p>
				If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the TotH administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service).
			</p>

			<h1>Addressing Grievances</h1>
			<p>
				If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify Tip of the Hats. We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.
			</p>

			<p>
				In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.
			</p>

			<h1>Contact Info</h1>
			<p>
				Please contact <a href="mailto:abuse@tipofthehats.org">abuse@tipofthehats.org</a> if you need to report a problem or address a grievance related to an abuse report.
			</p>

			<p>
				You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.
