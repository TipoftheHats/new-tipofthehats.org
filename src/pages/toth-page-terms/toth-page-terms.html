			<h2>Virtual Items</h2>

				In-game items from the game Team Fortress 2 (TF2).
			</p>

			<h2>Tracker / Donation Tracker</h2>

				<br>The tracker can be viewed here: http://tracker.tipofthehats.org/
			</p>

			<h1>Privacy</h1>

			</p>

			<h1>Transparency</h1>
			<p>
				All financial donations go directly to Children's Oncology Services, Inc. The associated email of the
				charity that receives the donations is lkunkel@onestepcamp.org. When donating through the tracker, you should
				also receive a donation receipt from noreply@tipofthehats.org.
			</p>

			<h1>Donations</h1>
			<h2>Virtual Item Donations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>are <b>not</b> tax-deductible.</li>
				<li>cannot be refunded.</li>
				<li>do not count towards the Team Fortress 2 in-game "Tipped Lid" item.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Virtual Item Donations made on our
				<a href="https://scrap.tf/toth" target="_blank">ScrapTF fundraiser page</a> are sold for cash
				on MarketplaceTF. The sale price of the item is then donated to Camp One Step. The listed value of the
				item is added to our donation total as soon as the donation transaction has completed -- we do not wait
				until the item has been sold on MarketplaceTF. Virtual Item Donations cannot be put towards donation
				incentives and challenges.
			</p>

			<h2>Monetary Donations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>are tax-deductible.</li>
				<li>cannot be refunded.</li>
				<li>do not count towards the Team Fortress 2 in-game "Tipped Lid" item.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Donations that go towards donation incentives and challenges are only valid through our donation
				tracker. PayPal is currently the only means of donating. If you would like your name removed from our
				donation tracker, please email support@tipofthehats.org with your relevant donation information.
			</p>

			<h2>Twitch Bits/Cheering Contributions</h2>

					those who contribute through bits/cheering at this time.

				not received by donating items or money to Tip of the Hats.

				You can subscribe to our Twitch channel at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tipofthehats"
				target="_blank">https://www.twitch.tv/tipofthehats</a> to receive our channel emotes across Twitch.
