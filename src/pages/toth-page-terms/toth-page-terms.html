			<h1>Privacy</h1>
			<p>
				Tip of the Hats only collects personal information you willingly provide through the donation tracker.
				This information is not sold or otherwise given to any outside parties. Any personally identifiable
				information provided to us is used solely for Tip of the Hats purposes. If you would like your
				information hidden or removed, please email support@tipofthehats.org.

			<h1>Donations</h1>
			<h2>Virtual Item Donations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>are <b>not</b> tax-deductible.</li>
				<li>cannot be refunded.</li>
				<li>count towards an in-game medal reward</li>
				<li>do not count towards the Team Fortress 2 in-game "Tipped Lid" item.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Virtual Item Donations made on our
				<a href="https://scrap.tf/toth" target="_blank">primary ScrapTF fundraiser page</a> are sold for cash
				on MarketplaceTF. The sale price of the item is then donated to One Step Camp. The listed value of the
				item is added to our donation total as soon as the donation transaction has completed -- we do not wait
				until the item has been sold on MarketplaceTF. Virtual Item Donations cannot be put towards donation
				incentives and challenges.
			</p>

			<p>
				Virtual Item Donations made on our
				<a href="https://scrap.tf/tothgiveaways" target="_blank">secondary ScrapTF fundraiser page</a> are to
				be given away during the event. It may not be possible for us to give away all items received from this
				fundraiser. In the event that there are leftover items, we will evaluate the best way to make use of
				them in our next event.
			</p>

			<h2>Monetary Donations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>are tax-deductible.</li>
				<li>cannot be refunded.</li>
				<li>count towards an in-game medal reward</li>
				<li>do not count towards the Team Fortress 2 in-game "Tipped Lid" item.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Donations that go towards donation incentives and challenges are only valid through our donation
				tracker. PayPal is currently the only means of donating. If you would like your name removed from our
				donation tracker, please email support@tipofthehats.org with your relevant donation information.
			</p>

			<h1>Rewards</h1>

			<h2>In-game Medals</h2>
			<p>
				We offer in-game rewards to donors who give $10 (Tier 1) or more. A higher reward is given to donors
				who give $30 (Tier 2) or more, and the highest reward is given to donors who give $100 (Tier 3) or
				more. These rewards are not cumulative. For example: a Tier 3 donor will only receive the Tier 3 reward.
				They will not also receive the Tier 2 and Tier 1 rewards.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tier 1: donate $10 or more (cash or virtual items)</li>
				<li>Tier 2: $30 or more (cash or virtual items)</li>
				<li>Tier 3: $100 or more (cash or virtual items)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				When donating cash on our donation tracker, donors <b>must sign in through Steam</b> to have their
				cash donations count towards a reward tier. Without signing in through Steam, rewards cannot be awarded.
			</p>

			<p>
				Medals will be distributed to applicable donors a few weeks after the event. If you feel you should
				have received a medal and did not, please email support@tipofthehats.org with the email you donated
				under (if you donated cash via the tracker) along with your SteamID64. To find your SteamID64, please
				use <a href="https://steamid.io/lookup" target="_blank">https://steamid.io/lookup</a>
			</p>

			<h2>The Tipped Lid</h2>
			<p>
				The Tipped Lid can be purchased in the Team Fortress 2 shop for $4.99 USD. All revenue
				(excluding the cut Valve takes) goes directly to Children's Oncology Services, Inc. The Tipped Lid is
				not received by donating items or money to Tip of the Hats.
