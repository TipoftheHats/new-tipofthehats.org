			<h2>Virtual Items</h2>
			<p>
				In-game items from the game Team Fortress 2 (TF2).
			</p>

			<h2>Tracker / Donation Tracker</h2>
			<p>
				Used to donate money along with view prizes, donors, and donations.
				<br>The tracker can be viewed here: http://tracker.tipofthehats.org/
			</p>

			<h1>Privacy</h1>
			<p>
				Tip of the Hats only collects personal information you willingly provide through the donation tracker.
				This information is not sold or otherwise given to any outside parties. Any personally identifiable
				information provided to us is used solely for Tip of the Hats purposes. If you would like your
				information hidden or removed, please email support@tipofthehats.org.
			</p>

			<h1>Transparency</h1>
			<p>
				All financial donations go directly to Children's Oncology Services, Inc. The associated email of the
				charity that receives the donations is lkunkel@onestepcamp.org. When donating through the tracker, you should
				also receive a donation receipt from noreply@tipofthehats.org.
			</p>

			<h1>Donations</h1>

				<li>count towards an in-game medal reward</li>

			</ul>
			<p>
				Virtual Item Donations made on our
				<a href="https://scrap.tf/toth" target="_blank">ScrapTF fundraiser page</a> are sold for cash
				on MarketplaceTF. The sale price of the item is then donated to Camp One Step. The listed value of the
				item is added to our donation total as soon as the donation transaction has completed -- we do not wait
				until the item has been sold on MarketplaceTF. Virtual Item Donations cannot be put towards donation
				incentives and challenges.
			</p>

			</ul>
			<p>
				Donations that go towards donation incentives and challenges are only valid through our donation
				tracker. PayPal is currently the only means of donating. If you would like your name removed from our
				donation tracker, please email support@tipofthehats.org with your relevant donation information.

			<h1>Rewards</h1>

			<h2>In-game Medals</h2>
			<p>
				We offer in-game (Team Fortress 2) rewards to donors who give $10 (Tier 1) or more. A higher reward is
				given to donors who give $30 (Tier 2) or more, and the highest reward is given to donors who give
				$100 (Tier 3) or more. These rewards are not cumulative. For example: a Tier 3 donor will only
				receive the Tier 3 reward. They will not also receive the Tier 2 and Tier 1 rewards.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tier 1: donate $10 or more (cash or virtual items)</li>
				<li>Tier 2: $30 or more (cash or virtual items)</li>
				<li>Tier 3: $100 or more (cash or virtual items)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				When donating cash on our donation tracker, donors <b>must sign in through Steam</b> to have their
				cash donations count towards a reward tier. Without signing in through Steam, rewards cannot be awarded.
			</p>

			<p>
				Medals will be distributed to applicable donors a few weeks after the event. If you feel you should
				have received a medal and did not, please email support@tipofthehats.org with the email you donated
				under (if you donated cash via the tracker) along with your SteamID64. To find your SteamID64, please
				use <a href="https://steamid.io/lookup" target="_blank">https://steamid.io/lookup</a>

				not received by donating items or money to Tip of the Hats.
